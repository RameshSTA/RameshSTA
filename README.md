## Key Projects

### [FinGraph: ASX GraphRAG Risk Engine](https://github.com/RameshSTA/FinGraph-ASX-GraphRAG-Engine)  
*Tech Stack: LlamaIndex, Neo4j AuraDB, Streamlit Cloud, Groq API, Git*  
- Reduced **manual financial due diligence review time by ~40%** by architecting an Agentic RAG system that combined vector search with knowledge graph traversal.  
- Increased **retrieval accuracy by 40%** by engineering a hybrid pipeline that connected scattered data points across complex annual reports.  
- Minimized **hallucination rates in financial extractions** by developing a custom parsing agent with LlamaParse to accurately extract tables and figures.  
- Achieved **<10ms inference latency** by integrating Groq LPU hardware acceleration, enabling real‑time analysis of ASX reports.  

### [AuraFin: Hybrid XGBoost/PyTorch Risk Engine](https://github.com/RameshSTA/Hybrid-XGBoostPyTorch-System)  
*Tech Stack: Python, XGBoost, PyTorch, FastAPI, Docker, Streamlit*  
- Delivered **$21.8M projected savings per batch** by engineering a Neuro‑Symbolic Risk Engine that optimised decision thresholds using a custom Financial Loss Function.  
- Ensured **regulatory compliance and eliminated data leakage** by conducting forensic data auditing and engineering linearised risk features (LTV, DTI).  
- Enabled **real‑time risk assessment for business users** by deploying the model via scalable microservices (FastAPI, Docker) and Streamlit dashboards.  
- Improved **classification accuracy on imbalanced datasets (1:20 ratio)** by benchmarking hybrid architectures and fine‑tuning XGBoost hyperparameters.  

### [TensorTwin: Supply Chain Optimizer](https://github.com/RameshSTA/Hybrid-LSTM-XGBoost-Supply-Chain-Optimizer)  
*Tech Stack: Python, PyTorch (LSTM), XGBoost, NumPy, Streamlit, Plotly*  
- Released **$680k capital per distribution node** while maintaining **98% SLA compliance** by replacing static heuristics with a stochastic (s, S) policy model.  
- Reduced **forecast error rates by 12%** by fusing PyTorch LSTMs and XGBoost in a hybrid ensemble model.  
- Quantified **supply chain risk exposure under volatile conditions** by developing a Monte Carlo simulation engine that ran 5,000 scenarios.  
- Guaranteed **model stability and reliability during deployment** by implementing Rolling‑Origin Cross‑Validation to audit performance against time‑dependent data shifts.  

### [Product Recommendation System](https://github.com/RameshSTA/Product-Recommendation-System)  
*Tech Stack: Python, BERT, Scikit‑learn, Google Cloud (BigQuery, Vertex AI)*  
- Increased **user engagement by 15%** by developing a BERT‑based product recommendation system.  
- Improved **system accuracy by 25%** by optimising recommendation algorithms for personalised delivery.  
- Ensured **real‑time, scalable recommendation delivery** by deploying the solution on Google Cloud using BigQuery and Vertex AI.  

### [Tic‑Tac‑Toe AI](https://github.com/RameshSTA/TicTacToe-AI)  
*Tech Stack: C++, Git, GitHub*  
- Demonstrated **advanced algorithmic optimisation** by implementing the minimax algorithm for AI opponent decision‑making.  
- Enhanced **user experience and versatility** by designing multiple game modes (player vs. player, player vs. computer).  
- Delivered a **bug‑free, reliable application** by conducting rigorous testing and debugging under complex scenarios.
