# Ramesh Shrestha

### Software Engineer (AI Stream) | Data Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer

Based in **Sydney, Australia**, I bridge the gap between software engineering and data science. While many professionals focus solely on model training, I possess the engineering rigour to build **scalable, production-ready AI systems**.

My work focuses on **Hybrid Neural Architectures**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and **Supply Chain Optimization**. I hold a Bachelor of Software Engineering (AI) and full working rights in Australia (Visa until March 2028).
